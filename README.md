* This app allows  the user to input a train's information via a modal when the "Add Train" button is clicked.
    * The form validates the train's information before the user is allowed to submit. 

* Upon submission the train's information is stored in Firebase DB and dynamically displayed on the table of trains.

* The app reloads every minute and uses Moment.js to keep the times from Firebase up to date.
